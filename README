## Usage - diseaseSim.py:
   1. Default values: python3 diseaseSim.py
   2. python3 diseaseSim.py <'V'/'M'> < POPULATION > < INFECTED > < COLS > < ROWS > 
                                 < STEPS > <'Y'/'N'> [< infect prob > < heal prob >]

    Example to copy: $ python3 diseaseSim.py V 100 60 15 15 10 Y [0.60 0.15]

## Usage - disease_sweep.sh:
    ./disease_sweep.sh <neighbourhood> <pop> <infected> <row/col step> <low_row>
                       <high_row> <low_col> <high_col>

    Example to copy: $ ./disease_sweep.sh M 100 20 10 15 25 15 25
